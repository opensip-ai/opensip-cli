# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenSIP CLI are documented here.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

Initial public release of OpenSIP CLI on the `@opensip-cli/*` + `opensip-cli`
identity. This is a `0.x` release: the public API (the Tool contract, the check
authoring API, the config + payload schemas, and the CLI surface) is not yet
frozen, and breaking changes may land on minor (`0.y`) bumps until `1.0.0`.

### Added

- `opensip` command distributed by the `opensip-cli` npm package.
- Polyglot `fit` checks across TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, Rust, and C/C++.
- CI baseline ratchet for surfacing net-new findings without blocking on an
  existing backlog.
- SARIF output and signal-sync plumbing for the upcoming OpenSIP Cloud.
- Static `graph` analysis with architecture rules, blast-radius signals, cycle
  detection, large-function detection, and duplicated-body detection.
- Self-contained HTML dashboard reports.
- `sim` engine for scenario-based load, chaos, and adversarial testing.
- Project scaffolding via `opensip init`.
- Plugin system for custom checks, recipes, scenarios, graph adapters, and full
  tools.
- Project-local and global extension paths with explicit trust controls.
- Session history, replay, and purge commands.
