# Show me each loop

opensip-cli ships four first-party tools. Each answers a different question shape:

| Tool | Question | Unit of work |
|---|---|---|
| `fit` | "Is the codebase clean?" | A **check** — runs once per file, returns violations. |
| `sim` | "Does it behave correctly under stress?" | A **scenario** — drives traffic against your service and asserts on the result. |
| `graph` | "What is reachable from where?" | A **rule** over the static call graph — authored with `defineRule` (parallel to `defineCheck`); ten ship in the box. |
| `yagni` | "What could we remove safely?" | A **detector** — ranks advisory reduction candidates with `metadata.yagni` evidence; two ship in the MVP. |

One concrete sample of each, below. After you've seen them, [quick start](/docs/opensip-cli/00-start/00-quick-start/) shows you how to run them.

---

## `fit` — a check

A check is one file. Drop it under `opensip-cli/fit/checks/` and the platform finds it on the next run.

```js
// opensip-cli/fit/checks/no-fixme.mjs
import { defineCheck } from '@opensip-cli/fitness';

export default defineCheck({
  id: '0a0a0a0a-0a0a-4a0a-8a0a-0a0a0a0a0a0a',
  slug: 'no-fixme-comments',
  description: 'No FIXME comments left in source',
  tags: ['quality', 'documentation'],
  scope: { languages: ['typescript'], concerns: [] },
  contentFilter: 'raw',
  analyze(content, filePath) {
    const violations = [];
    content.split('\n').forEach((line, idx) => {
      if (/\bFIXME\b/.test(line)) {
        violations.push({
          line: idx + 1,
          message: `FIXME comment found: ${line.trim()}`,
          severity: 'warning',
        });
      }
    });
    return violations;
  },
});
```

`analyze(content, filePath)` runs once per file. Return an array of violations. Empty array = passed. Recipes under `opensip-cli/fit/recipes/` compose checks into named lineups for CI. Deeper detail: [plugin authoring](/docs/opensip-cli/50-extend/01-plugin-authoring/) and [recipes and checks](/docs/opensip-cli/20-fit/01-recipes-and-checks/).

```text
> opensip fit --check no-fixme-comments
  ✗ no-fixme-comments   312 files,   2 violations
  0 Passed, 1 Failed (2 Errors, 0 Warnings) | Duration 0.4s

> echo $?
1
```

Exit code drives CI. That's the whole contract.

---

## `sim` — a scenario

A scenario describes a load (or chaos) workload and the assertions that should hold against the result. Drop it under `opensip-cli/sim/scenarios/`.

```js
// opensip-cli/sim/scenarios/checkout-burst.mjs
import { defineLoadScenario } from '@opensip-cli/simulation';

export default defineLoadScenario({
  id: '11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111',
  name: 'checkout-burst',
  description: 'Sustain 200 RPS checkout traffic for 30s',
  tags: ['load', 'checkout'],
  duration: { value: 30, unit: 'seconds' },
  rampUp: { value: 5, unit: 'seconds' },
  targetRps: 200,
  personas: [
    {
      name: 'shopper',
      weight: 1.0,
      action: async () => {
        await fetch('http://localhost:3000/checkout', { method: 'POST', body: '{}' });
      },
    },
  ],
  assertions: [
    { name: 'p99-under-500ms', assert: (r) => r.p99LatencyMs < 500 },
    { name: 'error-rate-under-1pct', assert: (r) => r.errorRate < 0.01 },
  ],
});
```

The two scenario kinds — `defineLoadScenario`, `defineChaosScenario` — each emit the same `RunnableScenario` shape with a different `kind:` discriminator. Recipes compose scenarios the same way fit recipes compose checks. Deeper detail: [scenarios and recipes](/docs/opensip-cli/30-sim/01-scenarios-and-recipes/).

> Simulation is opt-in. The scenarios run against targets you own or control.

## `graph` — a rule on the call graph

`graph` is an architectural *peer* of `fit`: rules are authored with
`defineRule` — the call-graph analogue of `defineCheck` — selected through the
same shared recipe substrate, and their findings land in sessions and the
dashboard exactly like fitness checks. The difference is the *input*: where a
check sees `(content, filePath)`, a rule sees the engine **dataset** (the
catalog, the indexes, and a derived feature layer). The engine builds your
project's static call graph in a staged pipeline (discover → walk → resolve →
index → derive features → render); ten built-in rules consume that dataset and
emit findings.

```text
> opensip graph
  Graph
  Catalog: 4,128 functions, 23,201 edges   Project: ~/work/my-app
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ✓ orphan-subtree              0 violations
  ✗ duplicated-function-body    3 violations
  ✓ no-side-effect-path         0 violations
  ✗ test-only-reachable         1 violation
  ✓ always-throws-branch        0 violations
  ✗ large-function              2 violations
  ...

  ... | Duration 2.5s   (incremental rebuild)
```

The ten rules, in two groups. Reachability and duplication:

- **`orphan-subtree`** — functions reachable from nothing (no entry point, no test).
- **`duplicated-function-body`** — distinct functions whose bodies hash the same (refactor candidates).
- **`no-side-effect-path`** — code paths that should have side effects but don't (e.g. a logged-out branch that doesn't log).
- **`test-only-reachable`** — code only reached from test files (likely dead in production).
- **`always-throws-branch`** — branches that always throw, suggesting an unreachable code path.

Structural (fed by the engine feature layer):

- **`large-function`** — functions whose body exceeds a configured line count.
- **`wide-function`** — functions taking too many parameters.
- **`high-blast-untested`** — functions with a high blast radius that no test reaches (fixable by adding a test).
- **`cycle`** — functions participating in a call cycle (a strongly-connected component); cross-package cycles are flagged at higher severity.
- **`unexpected-coupling`** — package dependency cycles (two packages that import each other, A→B→A). Bounded and breakable; statistical "coupling outlier" rankings stay a dashboard insight, not a gate.

Per-function metrics (size, fan-out, blast radius, test coverage) are computed once by the engine feature layer; rules query them, and the dashboard's graph view surfaces them as the same findings — one source of truth, no client-side recomputation.

Like `fit`, `graph` ships with a gate flow: `--gate-save` captures today's catalog as a baseline, `--gate-compare` fails the run when new violations appear. Five language adapters ship: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java. Deeper detail: [stages and catalog](/docs/opensip-cli/40-graph/01-stages-and-catalog/) and [rules and gating](/docs/opensip-cli/40-graph/02-rules-and-gating/).

---

## `yagni` — a detector run

`yagni` is advisory by default — it surfaces ranked reduction candidates for human review, not automatic deletions.

```bash
opensip yagni --json
```

Each finding carries `metadata.yagni`: detector slug, confidence (`low` | `medium` | `high`), a preservation argument, validation steps, and structured evidence. Two bundled detectors ship today: `unused-config-surface` (AST/config evidence) and `duplicate-body-candidate` (exact-duplicate TS function bodies via `@opensip-cli/clone-detection`, ADR-0064). Near-duplicate analysis remains graph-only. Deeper detail: [YAGNI command reference](/docs/opensip-cli/55-yagni/01-command-reference/).

```text
> opensip yagni
  YAGNI reduction audit
  Detectors: 2 ran   Candidates: 3 (high: 1, medium: 2)

  net: ~42 LOC possible (estimate)

> echo $?
0
```

Exit code stays `0` unless you raise `yagni.failOnErrors` / `yagni.failOnWarnings` in config.

## Same CLI, same envelope, four different questions

All four tools share the surface:

```bash
opensip fit     # codebase cleanliness
opensip sim     # runtime behavior under load
opensip graph   # call-graph shape
opensip yagni   # advisory reduction candidates
```

`fit`, `graph`, and `sim` exit non-zero when the bar breaks (with baseline/compare gates for incremental adoption). `yagni` is advisory by default (exit `0`). Each can emit JSON (`SignalEnvelope`) for agents and CI. The CLI doesn't know what any of them do internally — they're tools registered against a shared dispatcher. Same model lets a future `audit` or `lint` tool slot in without CLI changes.
