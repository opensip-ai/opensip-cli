# graph Tool — performance improvements

A first-pass performance plan, grounded in one real-world run: graph against the OpenSIP monorepo (5476 source files, 61131 catalog functions, 6192 inferred entry points).

> **Why now.** With Node's default 4 GB heap, the run crashed with `FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` after ~17 minutes — the V8 stack showed the OOM happening inside `CreateObjectLiteral`/`InterpreterEntryTrampoline`, i.e. allocating descriptors for AST node literals during TypeScript program construction. A retry with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=12288` completed in ~25 minutes with a peak resident of ~4.2 GB. The tool works on this codebase, but the run-time and the silent-OOM-then-investigate experience are both costs we can cut.

## 0. Goals & non-goals

**Goals**

- Peak memory ≤ 2 GB on the OpenSIP-scale (≈5500 files) workload, so the default Node heap is sufficient.
- Wall-clock ≤ 5 minutes for a cold run on the same workload.
- The first 1000-file run still emits useful progress logging within 30 s of start (today, stages run silently until completion).
- Zero loss of fidelity in the orphan-subtree and duplicated-function-body findings (they're the highest-signal rules on real codebases).

**Non-goals**

- Cross-language support beyond TypeScript (separate roadmap).
- Incremental-rebuild support beyond what stage-1 caching already does (separate plan).
- Distributed execution. Single-machine multi-core only.

## 1. Measured bottlenecks

### 1.1 Memory hotspots, in priority order

1. **TypeScript Program over the whole monorepo.** `ts.createProgram({ rootNames: files, options })` in `pipeline/inventory.ts:46` loads and parses every `.ts/.tsx` (3000+ files for OpenSIP). The subsequent `program.getTypeChecker()` forces full symbol binding. This is the dominant ~3 GB peak. The OOM stack confirms — V8 ran out of memory allocating AST node descriptors during program construction.

2. **`node.getText(sourceFile)` per function for hashing.** `inventory-helpers/hash-body.ts:40-42` does `node.getText()` → `stripComments(text)` → `normalizeWhitespace(s)` → `sha256(s)`. Four string allocations per function. Across ~61k functions, that's ~250 k transient string allocations.

3. **Two full AST walks.** Stage 1 (`buildInventory`) walks every file, then Stage 2 (`resolveEdges`) walks every file again from `edges.ts:62`. The catalog from Stage 1 stays live during Stage 2.

4. **`rebuildCatalog` doubles memory transiently.** `edges.ts:488` builds a fresh `functions` map by mapping every occurrence with new `calls` arrays. Old + new catalog both live until GC.

5. **`writeCatalog` materialises the catalog as one JSON string.** `cache/write.ts:22` calls `JSON.stringify(normalized, null, 2)` — for the OpenSIP catalog (~5500 files × multiple occurrences each), this is a ~50 MB single string allocation right before write.

6. **`normalizeCatalogForSerialization` copies every per-name occurrence array** for sorting (`cache/normalize.ts:24-27`). Multiplied across thousands of names.

### 1.2 CPU hotspots

1. **Sequential file processing.** Both stages process files one at a time on a single thread. During the 25-minute run, one core was pegged at 100 % while the other 7 were idle.

2. **Typechecker queried per call site.** Every property-access, new, JSX, and identifier reference invokes `typeChecker.getSymbolAtLocation(...)`. Tens of thousands of call sites × the checker's per-query work dominates Stage 2 wall-clock.

3. **SHA-256 + stripComments + whitespace-normalize per function.** Small cost individually; 61k × the chain adds up to seconds.

### 1.3 UX gap

When the run crashes with the heap-OOM signature, the user sees a 50-line V8 stack trace and no graph-side context. There's no early "your input has 5500 files; consider `--max-old-space-size=8192`" hint. No progress emission during the silent middle of Stage 1.

## 2. Phased plan

Phases are ordered by **payoff per unit of engineering effort**, not by what's most architecturally satisfying. Phase 0 is the smallest change that unblocks running on a default Node heap; phase 5 is structural and large.

### Phase 0 — UX hint + heap-size guidance (≤ 1 hour)

**Scope.** Emit a startup warning when `discoverFiles` returns > 1000 files, recommending `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` (or higher). Document the threshold and rationale in the graph README.

**Files**
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cli/graph.ts` — startup check after `discoverFiles`.
- `packages/graph/engine/README.md` — heap-sizing section.

**Acceptance**
- A run on a 1500-file project emits a single `cli.warn(...)` line within 1 second of start, naming the file count and the suggested flag.
- Below the threshold, no warning.

**Why first.** Lands in an hour, immediately changes the failure mode of large-repo runs from "silent OOM at minute 17" to "actionable hint at minute 0".

---

### Phase 1 — Free the Program after Stage 2 (≤ 1 day)

**Scope.** The `RunGraphResult` returned by `runGraph` should not retain the `ts.Program`. Currently the program is held until function return via the inventory + edges variables. Once Stage 2 finishes, Stage 3+ (`buildIndexes`, rules) only need the `Catalog`. Drop the program reference so V8 can collect ~1–2 GB of bound AST before serialization runs.

**Files**
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cli/orchestrate.ts` — narrow `RunGraphResult` to `{ catalog, indexes, signals, resolutionStats, cacheHit }`; explicit `program = null` after edge resolution.
- `packages/graph/engine/src/pipeline/inventory.ts` — return the program separately so the orchestrator can drop it without changing the function's shape.

**Pre-work — verify the catalog is node-free.** The 25 % memory-drop target only holds if `FunctionOccurrence` retains zero references into the AST. Take a heap snapshot after Stage 2 and confirm no `FunctionOccurrence` field (or anything reachable from `Catalog.functions`) holds a `ts.Node`, `ts.SourceFile`, or `ts.Symbol`. If any field does, the program won't actually be collectible regardless of dropping the orchestrator's variable. The on-disk JSON shape suggests the catalog is node-free, but verify before targeting the drop.

**Acceptance**
- Heap snapshot after `resolveEdges` returns confirms no `ts.*` retainers reachable from `Catalog`.
- Peak resident drops by ≥ 25 % on the OpenSIP workload (target: 4.2 GB → ≤ 3.2 GB). If the snapshot reveals retained nodes, fix those first; the memory target is conditional on a clean catalog.
- All existing graph engine tests pass unchanged.

**Risk.** Low — purely a memory-management change. The program reference isn't part of the public output.

---

### Phase 2 — Stream the catalog write (≤ 1 day)

**Scope.** Replace `cache/write.ts:22`'s `JSON.stringify(normalized, null, 2)` + `writeFileSync` with a streamed Writer that emits:
- Top-level metadata (version, builtAt, etc.) as one JSON object.
- The `functions` field as a streamed object: write `"functions": {`, then for each sorted name write `"<name>": [...]` line-by-line, then `}`.

**Files**
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cache/write.ts` — replace single-string serialisation with `fs.createWriteStream` + chunked emit.
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cache/normalize.ts` — convert to an iterator that yields `[name, occurrences]` pairs in sorted order, so the writer doesn't need the whole normalised catalog in memory at once.

**Acceptance**
- Cache write peak (RSS delta during write) drops to a constant (≤ 50 MB regardless of catalog size).
- Cache read still works against the new file shape — same byte-stable JSON, same `JSON.parse` round-trip.
- Catalog file is byte-identical (or only-whitespace-different) to today's output, so existing on-disk caches aren't invalidated.

**Caveat — don't oversell this phase.** The OOM is in Stage 1's program construction, not in serialization. The 50 MB single-string allocation is real, but it isn't the limiting factor on the OpenSIP run. Doing this phase for hygiene is fine; positioning it as memory relief overstates the impact. Keep it in Wave 1 because it's small and removes a constant cost, but don't expect it to move the OOM threshold on its own.

**Risk.** Low. The on-disk format is unchanged; this is purely a serialisation refactor.

---

### Phase 3 — Drop `node.getText()` for hashing (≤ 0.5 day)

**Scope.** In `inventory-helpers/hash-body.ts:40`, replace `node.getText(sourceFile)` with `sourceFile.text.slice(node.getStart(sf), node.getEnd())`. `sourceFile.text` is a single string the program already holds; `slice` returns a substring of it (V8 implements substring sharing) instead of walking the AST to materialise text.

**Files**
- `packages/graph/engine/src/pipeline/inventory-helpers/hash-body.ts` — `digestFunctionBody` body change.
- Same package's tests confirm hashes are unchanged (the input to `stripComments` is the same string content).

**Acceptance**
- `pnpm --filter @opensip-tools/graph test` passes (hash regressions caught by `__tests__/hash-body.test.ts`).
- Stage 1 wall-clock drops measurably on a 1000+ file workload (target: ≥ 10 % reduction).

**Risk.** Low. The string content is identical; only the allocation path changes.

---

### Phase 4 — Combine Stage 1 + Stage 2 into one AST walk per file — SHIPPED 2026-05-17

**What landed.** New `packages/graph/engine/src/pipeline/walk.ts` performs a single AST descent per file, emitting both function occurrences (Stage 1's product) and a flat list of pre-located call-site records (`{ node, sourceFile, ownerHash, kind }`). The orchestrator in `cli/orchestrate.ts` calls `walkProgram` once, builds an initial catalog from the occurrences, and feeds the records to a new `resolveEdgesFromRecords` entry point in `edges.ts` that dispatches resolvers without re-walking. Legacy `buildInventory` and `resolveEdges` are retained for tests and external callers.

**Outcome on opensip-tools self-graph (694 files, ~7600 functions).** Wall-clock unchanged (~15.6 s baseline ↔ ~15.8 s post-Phase-4); catalog byte-identical (0 findings, same shape, same `Catalog.functions` keys). On this size the AST walk is a small fraction of total cost — `createProgram` + `getTypeChecker` + per-resolver `getSymbolAtLocation` dominate. The architectural win — eliminated duplicate `hashFunctionBody` calls (legacy Stage 2 re-hashed every function-shape via `hashOf`) and one fewer `forEachChild` per file — should materialize on monorepo-scale workloads where the walk is a larger share of total cost. The OpenSIP-target 30 % reduction should be re-measured once the perf-driving repo is available.

**Acceptance**
- Catalog output byte-identical (verified: 0 findings on self-graph, same as pre-refactor).
- All 241 engine tests pass.
- Wall-clock reduction unverified on small repos; deferred until OpenSIP-scale data.

---

### Phase 5 — Lazy typechecker init — SPIKED 2026-05-17, REJECTED

Spike outcome: **no net win**. Detail below for posterity.

**Spike attempt 1 — drop the eager call entirely.** Removing `program.getTypeChecker()` from `buildInventory` cut wall-clock from ~14 s to ~1.2 s (12× faster) and produced a "byte-identical" cached catalog vs. baseline. Looked dramatic. Wrong: the catalog comparison was an artifact of stale cache reads. With a clean run, the dropped path produces a *different* catalog (499 false-positive findings in opensip-tools-self-graph, vs. 0 with eager retained). Reason: Stage 1's visitors walk parent chains (`arrow-function.ts:52`, `function-expression.ts:51`, `method-declaration.ts:63`, `constructor-declaration.ts:44`, `getter-setter.ts:55`). When parent pointers are missing, `ts.isVariableDeclaration(undefined)` throws inside `inferNameFromParent`, the per-file `try/catch` swallows the throw, and the file's occurrences are silently lost. The differential test against the TS Compiler API caught this (`graph stage 1 finds the same callables as the TS API for packages/cli/src/index.ts` — graph found 0).

**Spike attempt 2 — `ts.setParentRecursive` per file instead of full `getTypeChecker`.** TypeScript exposes `ts.setParentRecursive(sourceFile, true)` as a runtime export (untyped; cast required). It sets parent pointers without triggering the binder. Substituting it for the eager `getTypeChecker()` call produced a correct catalog (0 findings on self-graph). But total wall-clock was unchanged: ~15.9 s vs. ~15.6 s baseline. The binder cost moved from Stage 1's eager call to Stage 2's first `getSymbolAtLocation`, exactly as the plan's risk section warned.

**Decision: leave the eager call in place.** Updated the inline comment in `inventory.ts` to record what was tried and why no win exists. The original "Force binder to run so parent pointers are set" comment is correct — it's not paranoia, the visitors really do depend on it.

---

### Phase 6 — Per-workspace-package mode (3–5 days)

**Scope.** Add a `--package <name>` (or `--scope <glob>`) flag that runs graph against a single workspace package's tsconfig. Cross-package call sites resolve as `unknown` (lower fidelity, much faster). For monorepos with many small packages, this turns "1 × 25-minute run" into "1 × 30-second run per package," parallelizable trivially via xargs / GNU parallel.

**Files**
- New `packages/graph/engine/src/cli/scope.ts` — resolves `--package`/`--scope` against `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `package.json` workspaces / npm workspaces.
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cli/graph.ts` — wire the flag into `discoverFiles`.
- `packages/graph/engine/README.md` — document the trade-off.

**Acceptance**
- A run with `--package @opensip/pipeline` completes in ≤ 60 s on the OpenSIP repo.
- Unresolved call sites that cross package boundaries are tagged `resolution: 'cross-package-unresolved'` (new variant) so consumers can see them.

**Risk.** Low. Strictly additive — existing global runs unchanged.

---

### Phase 7 — Parallelize Stage 1 via `worker_threads` (≤ 1 week, conditional on Wave 3 measurement)

**Pre-condition.** Phase 6 + xargs may already meet the 5-min Wave 3 target (see §4 Q7). Run that measurement first. Phase 7 only proceeds if a *single* package dominates the global run.

**Scope.** Partition source files across N workers (N = `os.cpus().length - 1`). Each worker creates an isolated Program over its slice and emits a partial catalog plus its own resolved edges for intra-partition call sites. Cross-partition sites are emitted from each worker as unresolved-with-target-name records `{ targetName, targetShape }`; the main thread runs `resolveByCatalogFallback` over those records against the merged catalog. Edges produced by the main-thread join are tagged `cross-partition-fallback` so consumers see the fidelity downgrade in `resolutionStats`. (See §4 Q5 for the design rationale and the resolver-by-resolver fidelity breakdown.)

**Files**
- New `packages/graph/engine/src/pipeline/parallel.ts` — the orchestrator.
- New `packages/graph/engine/src/pipeline/worker-entry.ts` — the worker body.
- `packages/graph/engine/src/cli/orchestrate.ts` — gate behind `--parallel` (or auto-enable when `files.length > 1000`).

**Acceptance**
- Wall-clock on the OpenSIP workload drops by ≥ 4× on an 8-core machine (target: post-Phase 4 17 min → ≤ 5 min on 8 cores).
- Catalog output is byte-identical to the single-threaded run (modulo non-deterministic Map iteration, which `normalizeCatalogForSerialization` already sorts away). If the cross-partition design accepts fidelity loss (option (a) above), this gate softens to "byte-identical except for cross-partition call sites tagged `cross-partition-fallback`," and the count of such sites must be reported in `resolutionStats`.
- Per-worker peak heap stays under 1.5 GB so the global Node heap (worker pool + main thread) fits in 8 GB.

**Risk.** Medium-high. Worker-thread boundaries are an error-prone surface (serialisation overhead, error propagation, GC tuning per worker). The cross-partition-resolution question above is the structural risk; the byte-identical-catalog acceptance gate is the implementation safety net.

## 3. Sequencing & deliverables

**Wave 1 — eliminate the silent OOM AND give users a fast escape hatch (≤ 1 week total)**
- Phase 0 (UX hint).
- Phase 1 (free the program).
- Phase 2 (stream the write).
- Phase 3 (slice-not-getText).
- Phase 6 (per-workspace mode) — *promoted from Wave 3.*

Expected after Wave 1: OpenSIP-scale global runs fit in 2 GB heap with no silent OOM, *and* per-package runs complete in ≤ 60 s, making graph viable for pre-commit hooks and per-package CI today rather than after Wave 2 ships.

> **Why Phase 6 moves up.** Phase 6 is the only phase that gives a usable workflow (sub-minute) to monorepo users *immediately*, with low risk and no dependency on the global-run perf work. Holding it for Wave 3 means users are stuck on slow global runs for ~2 more weeks while Phases 4 and 5 bake. The original ordering was "fix the global run first" — defensible, but Phase 6 unlocks pre-commit-hook usage that Waves 1–2 don't.

**Wave 2 — cut global-run wall-clock (≤ 1 week total)**
- Phase 5 spike — done 2026-05-17, no net win, Phase 5 dropped (see §2).
- Phase 4 (single AST walk).

Expected after Wave 2: OpenSIP wall-clock improvement from Phase 4 alone. Quantify after the refactor lands.

**Wave 3 — multi-core for the global run (≤ 1 week, scope contingent on measurement)**

Step 1 — measure Phase 6 + xargs against the OpenSIP-scale workload (≤ 1 hour):
```
time xargs -P 8 -I {} opensip-tools graph --package {} <<< "$(list-of-packages)"
```
- If wall-clock ≤ 5 min: Wave 3 becomes a thin shipping exercise. Add an `opensip-tools graph --packages <glob>` flag that iterates packages in-process with a worker pool, document the xargs pattern in the README, ship. Phase 7's `worker_threads`-on-one-Program design becomes deferred or unnecessary.
- If wall-clock > 5 min: identify the dominating package(s). Phase 7 becomes scoped to *those single-package cases*, not a general parallelism story.

Step 2 (only if step 1 motivates it) — measure resolver-fallback rates (≤ 1 hour, per §4 Q5):
- Instrument `property-access` and `polymorphic` resolvers; count checker-hits vs. catalog-fallback hits.
- If checker hits dominate, README must document the fidelity trade-off for parallel-mode users.

Step 3 (only if steps 1+2 motivate it) — Phase 7 implementation per §4 Q5 option (c):
- Workers resolve intra-partition edges normally.
- Cross-partition sites emit as `(targetName, targetShape)` unresolved records.
- Main thread runs `resolveByCatalogFallback` over those records against the merged catalog; edges tagged `cross-partition-fallback`.
- `resolutionStats` reports the cross-partition-fallback count.

Expected outcome: Wave 3 ships in days, not the original 1–2 weeks, by leaning on Phase 6 + a thin parallel wrapper. Phase 7's worker-thread infrastructure only built if the measurement justifies it.

**Wave 4 — incremental rebuild (deferred; scope after Wave 2 ships)**
- See §4 question 4. Today's "any file change → full rebuild" makes graph essentially unusable in watch mode on monorepos. Per-file occurrences cached, only changed files re-walked. Worth a dedicated plan.

## 4. Open questions

1. **Does `getTypeChecker()` in Stage 1 actually do something Stage 1 needs? — RESOLVED 2026-05-17.** Yes, it does. Stage 1 visitors walk parent chains (arrow-function name inference, method enclosing-class lookup); only the binder sets parent pointers, and only `getTypeChecker()` triggers the binder eagerly. Spike measured the alternatives: dropping the call gave 12× wall-clock improvement but produced silently wrong catalogs (visitors threw, errors swallowed by per-file try/catch); switching to `ts.setParentRecursive` produced correct catalogs but identical wall-clock to baseline (binder cost simply shifted to Stage 2's first `getSymbolAtLocation`). Phase 5 dropped from the plan; eager call retained.

2. **Should the cache file format change in Phase 2, or stay byte-identical? — RESOLVED 2026-05-17.** Stay byte-identical. The streamed writer uses a sentinel-split metadata serialization that emits the exact same bytes as the legacy `JSON.stringify(_, null, 2)` path, so existing on-disk caches survive the upgrade. Verified by golden-file test in `__tests__/cache/read-write.test.ts`.

3. **Is per-worker isolation enough in Phase 7? — RESOLVED 2026-05-17.** Yes. The TypeScript module is ~50 MB; with 7 workers that's ~350 MB of duplicated module memory. The plan's per-worker heap budget is 1.5 GB — the duplicated TS module is 3.3 % of that, dwarfed by the per-worker AST + symbol table (~600 MB on a 700-file partition). Sharing TypeScript across workers via `SharedArrayBuffer` would require deep work in TypeScript itself (closures, mutable internal tables); not worth the effort. Accept the duplication.

4. **What's the target for incremental runs? — Deferred to Wave 4.** Today Stage 1's cache invalidation is at file-list granularity (any file changes → full rebuild). A finer-grained invalidation (per-file occurrences cached, only changed files re-walked) is a separate plan worth scoping after Wave 2 ships. Not a Phase-7 blocker.

5. **How should Phase 7 handle cross-partition edges that today require the typechecker? — RESOLVED 2026-05-17 (option c, fallback-on-main).** The fidelity-loss surface is narrower than the original framing suggested. Of the seven Stage 2 resolvers, four (`direct-call`, `jsx`, `new-expression`, `value-reference`) already gracefully degrade to `resolveByCatalogFallback` when the checker doesn't help — cross-partition resolution costs them nothing. Two (`property-access`, `polymorphic`) genuinely depend on the checker; for these, cross-partition sites become catalog-fallback (high-recall, low-precision: matched by method name alone instead of by class). One (`shorthand-assignment`) behaves like value-reference.

   Design: workers resolve their own intra-partition edges normally. Cross-partition sites are emitted from workers as unresolved-with-target-name (and target-shape: 'method' / 'value' / etc.), and the main thread runs `resolveByCatalogFallback` against the merged catalog. Edges produced by the main-thread join are tagged `cross-partition-fallback` and the count is reported in `resolutionStats`. The Phase 7 acceptance gate softens to "byte-identical except for the `cross-partition-fallback` subset" — which is exactly what option (a) in the original framing offered, just with a clear implementation story.

   Optional measurement to do once before starting Phase 7 (≤ 1 hour): instrument `property-access` and `polymorphic` resolvers on the self-graph. Count what fraction of their hits actually came from the checker vs. the catalog-fallback layer. If most hits are already catalog-fallback in practice, Phase 7's fidelity loss on cross-partition sites is small and not worth a doc warning. If checker hits dominate, document the trade-off in the README so users running parallel mode know what they lose.

6. **Is there a string-interning win orthogonal to the phase plan?** At 61k function occurrences, file paths, qualified names, and resolution targets are heavily duplicated across catalog entries. A simple intern pool over `FunctionOccurrence.filePath` and `CallEdge.to` could shrink memory measurably without touching pipeline structure. Worth measuring with a heap snapshot during the Phase 1 work — if string duplication dominates, scope a Phase 1.5.

7. **Is Phase 7 still necessary now that Phase 6 ships? — RESOLVED 2026-05-17 (deferred pending measurement).** Phase 6 (`--package <name>`) reduced a global run to a per-package run. On monorepos with N reasonably-sized packages, `xargs -P 8 opensip-tools graph --package {}` provides 8-core parallelism today with zero new infrastructure: no worker_threads, no cross-partition edges, no merge logic, full per-package fidelity. Phase 7 is genuinely necessary only for **single-package giant-tsconfig** monorepos that Phase 6 can't split. The OpenSIP measurement run was 6 workspace packages; it might already meet Wave 3's 5-min target via Phase 6 + xargs.

   Resolution: before designing Phase 7, measure `xargs -P 8 opensip-tools graph --package {}` against the OpenSIP-scale workload. If wall-clock ≤ 5 min, scope Phase 7 down to "document the xargs pattern + add `opensip-tools graph --packages` for ergonomics" and defer the worker_threads design indefinitely. If wall-clock > 5 min (because one package dominates), proceed with Phase 7 against that single-package case only.
