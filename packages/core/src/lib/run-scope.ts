/**
 * @fileoverview RunScope — per-invocation execution scope.
 *
 * Owns the lifecycle of every singleton the codebase previously hung on
 * module-level state (logger, caches, registries, recipe-config slot,
 * project context, datastore thunk). Constructed exactly once per CLI
 * invocation; SaaS hosts construct one per concurrent run.
 *
 * Threading happens at the `ToolCliContext` boundary (Phase 5). Tools
 * read `cli.scope.foo` instead of reaching into module globals.
 *
 * AsyncLocalStorage seam: `runWithScope(scope, fn)` binds `scope` as
 * the current scope for the dynamic extent of `fn`. Library functions
 * deep inside the call tree (e.g. fitness's `getCheckConfig(slug)`)
 * read from `currentScope()` instead of `globalThis`. The two-copies-of-
 * fitness hazard documented at the prior `Symbol.for(globalThis)` site
 * is solved by ALS — both fitness copies share the same
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` instance exported from `@opensip-cli/core`.

// ─── AsyncLocalStorage seam ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `runWithScope(scope, fn)` binds `scope` for the dynamic extent of
// `fn`. Library functions read `currentScope()` instead of any
// module global.
//
// The ALS instance is pinned on `globalThis` so duplicate physical copies
// of `@opensip-cli/core` (pnpm `injectWorkspacePackages` hard-links fitness
// into the virtual store with its own nested core copy) still share one
// scope slot. A module-level `new AsyncLocalStorage()` would split the
// store across those copies and silently degrade content filters.
//
// Concurrency contract — two ways to bind a scope, with strict roles:
//
//   • `runWithScope(scope, fn)` / `runWithScopeSync(scope, fn)` —
//     bind `scope` for the dynamic extent of `fn` via
//     `AsyncLocalStorage.run`. This is the ONLY safe way to bind a
//     scope for concurrent or nested in-process work: each task's
//     scope is isolated to its own `fn`, runs nest cleanly, and two
//     overlapping runs never collide on the shared slot. SaaS hosts
//     and any in-process parallelism MUST use this.
//
//   • `enterScope(scope)` — the Commander single-command path ONLY:
//     one entry per CLI invocation, in the pre-action hook. It mutates
//     the single ALS slot (`enterWith`) for the rest of the async
//     context, so it is unsafe for concurrent or nested work. NEVER
//     call `enterScope` while another scope task is in flight; the
//     always-on guard throws `SYSTEM.SCOPE.REENTRANT` if a *different*
//     scope is already current.
//
// Per-run log isolation rides on the same seam: distinct scopes carry
// distinct `runId`s, and the logger reads `currentScope()?.runId`
// (wired below via `setRunIdProvider`), so concurrent runs produce
// non-colliding, per-run-filterable logs.
