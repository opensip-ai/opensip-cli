/**
 * render — static-render entry. Tool-agnostic; every tool that emits a
 * `CommandResult` reaches the user's terminal through this single seam.
 *
 * This is the one place that chooses the output medium: when stdout is a
 * TTY the result renders through Ink (themed; colorless under NO_COLOR via
 * the ThemeProvider); when stdout is piped/redirected/CI it renders as
 * plain text with no banner. Tools never make this choice — they return a
 * `CommandResult` and this seam picks Ink vs. text. (Migration is phased:
 * `resultToView` returns null for result types not yet expressed as a
 * view-model, and those still render through the legacy Ink App — TTY
 * only — until Phase 5 finishes the migration.)
 *
 * Every Ink/cli-ui import here is dynamic so this module loads no
 * React/Ink at startup — the hot `opensip-tools fit --json` path (which
 * uses `emitJson`, never this seam) stays React-free.
