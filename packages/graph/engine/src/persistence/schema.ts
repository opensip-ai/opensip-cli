 * fingerprint-mismatch checks without parsing the full payload.

 * Per-shard catalog fragment store (plan #2 — sharded build).

 * errors). A fragment is valid for incremental reuse only when BOTH its
 * `cache_key` (the shard's tsconfig/version/mode key) and its
 * `shard_fingerprint` (mtime+size over the shard's files) match the
 * current run — the same validity discipline as the full-catalog path.
 * On a rebuild, shards whose fingerprint matches load their fragment with
 * no parse; only changed shards re-run a worker.
 *
 * Schema note (flagged in the plan for a data-layer pass): this is a
 * draft — table-vs-column, stale-row retention, and a build-scoped sweep
 * are deferred. Replacement is per-shard upsert; stale rows for shards no
 * longer present are pruned by the orchestrator after a build.
