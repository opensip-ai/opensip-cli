/**
 * @opensip-tools/contracts — shared contract types.
 *
 * Tool packages (fitness, simulation) and the CLI entry-point both
 * depend on this package for:
 *   - CLI option / output / result types
 *   - Exit code constants and error suggestions
 *   - The cross-tool StoredSession type (the SessionRepo runtime + the
 *     sessions schema live in @opensip-tools/session-store)
 *
 * The GraphCatalog shape is DEFINED here (./graph-catalog.ts), not
 * re-exported from elsewhere. It is the contract surface between the
 * graph tool (which writes catalog.json) and @opensip-tools/dashboard
 * (which renders it): both producer and consumer depend on contracts
 * from below, so the shape lives in the layer beneath both. contracts
 * holds zero runtime dependency on dashboard or graph — these are
 * type-only declarations.
 *
 * contracts depends only on @opensip-tools/core. Tools depend on
 * contracts. The CLI entry-point depends on contracts and on every
 * tool package — the dependency graph stays acyclic.
